Summary


This report was meant to analyze a set of loans from a lending company and determine if their loans were healthy or high risk. We used two different models to predict these, one being a basic linear regression and the other a logistic regression with an over sampler. 

Model One 
Balanced Accuracy Score - 95%
Precision - Healthy Loans - 100%: Risky Loans - 85%
Recall - Healthy Loans - 99%: Risky Loans - 91%
F1-Score - Healthy Loans - 100%: Risky Loans - 88%

Model Two
Balanced Accuracy Score - 99%
Precision - Healthy Loans - 100%: Risky Loans - 84%
Recall - Healthy Loans - 99%: Risky Loans - 99%
F1-Score - Healthy Loans - 100%: Risky Loans - 91%

If I were to recommend a model I would select model one. Both models are very good at predicting healthy loans, but model one predicts risky loans at 1% better rate, and protecting a company from risky loans would be a top priority.
